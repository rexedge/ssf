					Executive bonus plans are used as a tool for employee
					retention and motivation, especially for key executives
					or high-performing employees. The promise of additional
					compensation in the form of life insurance premiums can

					executive bonus plans can also serve as a supplemental
					retirement income strategy. Cash value accumulated

					impact revenue, and erode client confidence. Key person
					insurance helps ensure continuity by providing funds to
					cover expenses during the transition period and
					mitigate financial losses.

					company's creditworthiness in the eyes of lenders and
					investors. It demonstrates that the company is prepared
